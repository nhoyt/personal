      <section>
        <h2>Three main objects</h2>

        <p>When creating a score, you will specify or create the following
          types of objects in Dorico:</p>
        <dl class="wide">
          <dt>Players:</dt>
          <dd>Solo instruments or sections</dd>

          <dt>Flows:</dt>
          <dd>Independent pieces of music that players are assigned to play</dd>

          <dt>Layouts:</dt>
          <dd>Formatting specifications for the score and parts</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Five major modes</h2>

        <p>The major modes in Dorico are like five separate programs, each with
          its own distinct set of features and user interface.</p>

        <h3>Setup mode</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Set up instruments, players, flows and layouts</li>
          <li>Assign instruments to players</li>
          <li>Assign players to layouts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Write mode</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Input and edit music</li>
          <li>Change rhythmic position of items</li>
          <li>Change the pitch of notes</li>
          <li>Delete notes and other items</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because of the way Dorico handles note input in relation to the
          rhythmic grid, it is generally best to specify a time signature
          before you begin inputting notes.</p>

        <h3>Engrave mode</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Make fine adjustments to notes and other items</li>
          <li>Determine how the pages of your project are laid out</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Play mode</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Change the playback template and assign VST instruments</li>
          <li>Input automation</li>
          <li>Adjust the mix</li>
          <li>Change the sounding duration of notes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Print mode</h3>
        <p>Print layouts or export them as graphics files or PDFs.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Important concepts</h2>

        <h3>Note durations and implicit rests</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The notation and division of notes and rests is determined by a
            set of rules and conventions that you have little to no control
            over.</li>
          <li>This means that note and rest durations can change and appear
            differently later, compared to when you first input them.</li>
          <li>Notes are treated as a single unit, even if they appear as a tie
            chain that contains multiple notes tied together.</li>
          <li>Implicit rests automatically fill the gaps between the notes you
            input.</li>
          <li>In combination with time signatures, this allows you to input
            only the notes you want with the duration required. It is not
            necessary to input rests between notes or input ties for notes
          that cross the half-bar, for example.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rhythmic position</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Notes and items exist at rhythmic positions, which are calculated
            using their place in musical time in the flow rather than their
            position in a specific bar that has a particular time signature.</li>
          <li>Because notes and items exist independently of bars and time
            signatures, you can change the time signature without changing when
            notes happen in relation to each other or adding rests at the end
            of each bar.</li>
          <li>Instead, the barlines simply move to different positions and the
            grouping of notes is updated as required, such as notating a quarter
            note as two tied eighth notes if it now straddles a barline or
            crosses the half-bar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using popovers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Popovers are triggered by certain key commands and allow you to
            perform various tasks using shorthand syntax while remaining in
            note input mode.</li>
          <li>These include adding different types of notations to your score
            such as key signatures and dynamics, or transposing a selection of
            notes.</li>
          <li>For example, once you reach the position where you want to input
            a new key signature, you can open the corresponding popover using
            its key command <span class="kbd">Shift K</span>, input the key
            signature you want, and then continue inputting notes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating projects</h2>

        <p>Projects specify players and instrumentation, and contain one or
          more flows. Each flow may have various layouts for different versions
          of the score and its parts.</p>

        <h3>New project from template</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>From the Dorico menu, select <span class="menu">File > New From
            Template ></span> [select template], or</li>
          <li>From the <span class="menu">Steinberg Hub</span>, select a
            template category, then a template, and then click
            <span class="menu">New from Template</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This places you directly in <span class="menu">Write Mode</span>.</p>

        <h3>New empty project</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Select <span class="menu">File > New</span> or press
            <span class="kbd">Cmd-N</span>, or</li>
          <li>From the <span class="menu">Steinberg Hub</span>, select
            <span class="menu">New Empty Project</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This places you in <span class="menu">Setup Mode</span>.</p>
