          <p>Hello! I'm Nick Hoyt and I've been an interaction designer for over twenty years.</p>
          <p>This is my online design portfolio, where I describe and link to some of the projects on which I've had the honor of serving as lead designer.</p>
          <p>In my view, the most interesting UX design projects involve interaction design, as defined by Alan Cooper in his book <em>About Face 2.0: The Essentials of Interaction Design</em>.</p>
          <p>Interaction design is not easy to define — it took Alan Cooper about 500 pages — but he begins by delving into the concept of goal-directed design, which involves developing a deep understanding of users' goals as they relate to a digital product.</p>
          <p>The insights gleaned from this book were instrumental to my professional development as a designer. Case in point: Defer any and all design decisions relating to how the user interface of an application will function until after the required user research is done regarding what users are trying to accomplish and what tasks are involved.</p>
          <p>By doing so, you avoid making unforced errors and can establish a design trajectory that steamlines the task flow of the application for users, speeding them on their way to achieving their goals.</p>

        <h2>Skip to Landmarks and Headings</h2>
        <div>
          <p>In IT accessibility, one of the most fundamental requirements involves ensuring that content on web pages is well-structured. This is accomplished by using (a) ARIA landmark regions and (b) properly nested headings (h1–h6).</p>
          <p>Well-structured documents allow all users to more easily scan for the information they are looking for, and help screen reader users quickly navigate to the various regions or heading-labeled sections on the page.</p>
          <p>‘Skip to Landmarks and Headings’, published in June 2021, is a browser extension for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skip-to-landmarks-and-hea/fjkpbfcodhflpdildjbmdhhmcoplghgf">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skipto/">Firefox</a> that identifies and provides navigation to the ARIA landmark regions and HTML section headings (h1–h6) of a web page. The extension provides a menu divided into two groups: (1) the important landmark regions and (2) an outline of the heading structure of the page.</p>
          <p>The ‘Skip to Landmarks and Headings’ extension provides a means for people using the keyboard to efficiently navigate to specific content on the page. The headings outline also provides an easy way for people to view the topics on a web page without having to scroll through the entire page.</p>

        <h2>Accessible IT Group: Web Design</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Designed over the period from summer of 2020 to spring of 2021 and utilizing a WordPress theme built from scratch during that same period, the <a href="https://accessibleit.disability.illinois.edu/">Accessible IT Group website</a> highlights the training courses, accessibility tools and other services provided by our group.</p>
          <p>Aside from its role as a publishing platform for the content described above, one of the main purposes we had in building the site was for it to serve as an example of how to design and build a website with accessibility as a primary focus.</p>
          <p>For example, the user interface, and in particular the menu system, incorporates SVG images that are capable of adapting their foreground or background colors to maintain visibility when visually impaired users view our content in high-contrast mode.</p>
          <p>Also, as one would expect of current websites, the design is fully responsive in adapting to the widely varying screen dimensions of modern devices.</p>

        <div>
          <p>In contrast to the accessibility checker approach for embedded HTML editors, the A11yFirst Project takes a proactive approach to accessible authoring.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/search/plugins/a11yfirst">A11yFirst Plugins for CKEditor</a> are document editing enhancements that promote and encourage the creation of accessible content as you edit.</p>
          <p>There have been more than 10,000 downloads total of the five A11yFirst plugins in the past eighteen months.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility Bookmarklets</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The <a href="https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/">Accessibility Bookmarklets</a> are the end result of what started as a ‘Show and Tell’ session at a monthly campus accessibility meeting. A local web developer demonstrated a bookmarklet she had developed that displayed the ARIA landmark regions on a web page.</p>
          <p>It became apparent that other types of bookmarklets could be developed that provided interactive visualizations relating to various sets of accessibility requirements, such as those related to headings, lists, images and forms.</p>
          <p>Through collaboration over many months, we developed a set of five bookmarklets, which many developers have found to be useful in getting an initial sense of whether a web page meets certain accessibility requirements.</p>

        <h2>Web Accessibility Evaluation Library</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The Evaluation Library is not a design project, per se. But I want to mention it because of its importance in allowing the Accessible IT Group to build accessibility evaluation tools that incorporate it as the evaluation engine.</p>
          <p>Without the Evaluation Library, which was developed mainly by Jon Gunderson, my colleague at the University of Illinois, the Functional Accessibility Evaluator and AInspector WCAG would not exist.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>AInspector WCAG: Firefox Extension</h2>
        <div>
          <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ainspector-wcag/">AInspector WCAG</a> is an open source add-on for the Firefox browser that analyzes the page loaded in the active tab for compliance with accessibility requirements defined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA), and for proper use of accessibility features defined by the HTML5 standard.</p>
          <p>AInspector WCAG uses the same Evaluation Library as the Functional Accessibility Evaluator, and thus its evaluation results are presented in the same format, using the terminology and rulesets, as FAE, except that only one page is evaluated.</p>
          <p>The first publicly available version (0.16.5) of AInspector WCAG (then called AInspector Sidebar) was released in Sep. 2014. It was designed and developed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">XUL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPCOM">XPCOM</a>, which predated the current WebExtensions platform.</p>
          <p>Mozilla stopped supporting XUL-based add-ons in Nov. 2017, at which time the add-on was ported to WebExtensions APIs and renamed AInspector WCAG.</p>

        <h2>Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)</h2>
        <div>
          <p>When I joined what is now called the Accessible IT Group at the University of Illinois in 2005, I worked as lead designer and front end developer of version 1.0 of the <a href="https://fae.disability.illinois.edu/">Functional Accessibility Evaluator</a>, a web application that uses web crawling to evaluate pages within websites.</p>
          <p>The original working prototypes were developed using PHP, but after a good deal of research, we transitioned to the Django platform. I designed and developed all of the Django templates that comprise the user interface of the application.</p>
          <p>I also developed a conceptual model for web accessibility evaluation that was instrumental in creating the terminology and task flows that users could readily understand.</p>
          <p>FAE was the first tool we developed that was built on top of the Evaluation Library, which encodes a set of accessibility rules that was the result of years of collaboration with accessibility professionals at the University of Illinois and from other universities and industry.</p>

        <h2>Conceptual Models</h2>
        <div>
          <p>I would be remiss if I did not point out how important it was to discover the value and benefits of conceptual modeling to the design process. The best book I know of on this topic is <em>Conceptual Models: Core to Good Design</em> by Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson.</p>
          <p>The purpose of creating a conceptual model for an application is to clarify all of the internal relationships of the objects and actions that users encounter as they perform the various tasks in order to accomplish their goals.</p>
          <p>When designing multiple applications that are based on the same kinds of actions and objects, a conceptual model also becomes invaluable for maintaining consistency with terminology and labels that users interact with across those applications.</p>

        <h2>Fidelity Investments: Contribution Calculator</h2>
        <div>
          <p>My first project as a user interface designer and developer with Fidelity Investments was the creation of the Contribution Calculator. It was developed as a Java applet, which was a big thing in 1997. However, with Java SDKs being less than a couple of years old, there were not many facilities for building applets with rich UI components.</p>
          <p>Due to the paucity of the component APIs, I found it necessary to build from scratch the graphing capabilities that were needed for the applet. The original version of the calculator was deployed on the NetBenefits site for over ten years.</p>
          <p>During my first year at Fidelity, I build two addiion financial tools: the Withdrawal Calculator and the Take Home Pay calculator, both also Java applets. I also made some enhancements to the Contribution Calculator in the early 2000s.</p>

        <h2>Fidelity Investments: NetBenefits Redesign</h2>
        <div>
          <!--
          <p>My portfolio would not be complete without including one of the most challenging, and successful projects that I was ever part of. In 1998, NetBenefits, Fidelity's online app that provides customer access to retirement savings accounts, had surpassed the one million users mark, and it was clear that the application was in need of updating.</p>
          <p>Tom Tullis, VP of User Experience Research, had seen my work as the designer and developer of the Contribution Calculator, and promoted me to the position of lead user interface designer for the redesign project.</p>
          <p>Working closely with a very savvy business analyst, we conducted user research through contextual inquiry and user interviews.</p>
          <p>According to an article published in the New York Times, in the year following the deployment of the new design of ‘NetBenefits’, the number of retirement savings account customer service calls was reduced by 50 percent compared to the previous year.</p>
          -->
          <p>In the fall of 1998 the retirement services division of Fidelity Investments determined that <a href="https://nb.fidelity.com/public/nb/default/home">NetBenefits</a>, their flagship web application that provides customer access to 401k retirement savings accounts, needed to be updated.</p>
          <p>At that point in time, NetBenefits had reached the one million customers milestone, and Fidelity, being a market leader in the uses of technology, wanted the application redesigned to make it as easy as possible for its customers to use.</p>
          <p>Having designed and developed two financial planning tools for Fidelity that had been deployed within NetBenefits in the previous year, I was interviewed by Tom Tullis, VP of User Experience Design, and subsequently asked to lead the user interface redesign of NetBenefits.</p>
          <p>I worked closely with an astute and very savvy business analyst, conducting user research through contextual inquiry and user interviews, and met on a regular basis with business managers in charge of the project.</p>
          <p>Through two rounds of usability testing of our new prototypes in Fidelity’s state of the art Human Interface Design Lab, we were able to determine that users understood the navigation structure and could easily find the options they were looking for.</p>
          <p>The resulting design, deployed in June 1999, was cited in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/business/a-high-tech-vision-lifts-fidelity.html">New York Times article</a> in Sep. 2000, which stated that “57 percent of the contacts made by retirement-account customers have come online this year, compared with 16 percent in 1998.”</p>
