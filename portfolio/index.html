      <!-- AInspector for Firefox -->

        <h2>AInspector for Firefox</h2>
        <div>
          <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ainspector-wcag/">AInspector for Firefox</a> is an open source browser extension that evaluates web pages for compliance with widely accepted accessibility requirements, as defined by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Levels A and AA, Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA), and the HTML 5 standard.</p>
          <p>AInspector uses the same Evaluation Library as the Functional Accessibility Evaluator, and thus its evaluation results are presented in the same format, using the same terminology and ruleset as FAE.</p>
          <details>
            <summary>About the Design</summary>
            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>How to align all of the terminology and labeling of features present in AInspector with those in FAE and keep them in sync?</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Manually and simultaneously make changes in both applications whenever a terminology or feature change occurs in one or the other.</li>
              <li>Create a separate repository where all of the terminology and UI labeling is defined, and then make sure that both applications are kept in sync with it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <p>Based on a 2002 paper, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220382707_Conceptual_models_begin_by_designing_what_to_design"><i> Conceptual models: begin by designing what to design (PDF)</i></a> by Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson, I created the <a href="https://github.com/ainspector/design/wiki/Conceptual-Model-for-Web-Accessibility-Evaluation">Conceptual Model for Web Accessibility Evaluation</a>. I was the author and editor of the conceptual model, but its content is based on extensive input from our multi-organization group whose membership included a number of web accessibility experts.</p>
            <p>This conceptual model served as the basis for all terminology, and the organization of evaluation results in all AInspector screens and FAE reports.</p>
          </details>
          <p>The first publicly available version of AInspector was released in Sep. 2014. It was designed and developed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">XUL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPCOM">XPCOM</a>, which predated the current WebExtensions APIs.</p>
          <p>After Mozilla stopped supporting XUL-based add-ons in Nov. 2017, the add-on was ported to use the latest WebExtensions APIs and renamed AInspector WCAG.</p>
          <p>AInspector has been updated in 2022 with additional features, including the ability to export data in CSV format. Version 2.0 was released in March.</p>

      <!-- A11yFirst Project -->

      <section>
        <h2>A11yFirst Project: CKEditor Plugins</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/search/plugins/a11yfirst">A11yFirst Plugins for CKEditor</a> are document editing enhancements that promote and encourage the creation of accessible content as you edit.</p>
          <p>In contrast to the accessibility checker approach for embedded HTML editors, the A11yFirst Project takes a proactive approach to accessible authoring.</p>
          <p>The A11yFirst Project was responsible for creating four editing plugins for CKEditor 4: ‘Heading/Paragraph’, ‘Character Style’, ‘Image’ and ‘Link’, along with a ‘Help’ system that explained the various choices in the associated dialog boxes and menus.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>About the Design</summary>

            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>Which editor functions provide opportunities for proactively assisting authors in creating accessible content as they edit, as opposed to forcing authors to use accessibility checking tools that are tangential to the editing process?</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Inserting headings</li>
              <li>Inserting images</li>
              <li>Creating links</li>
              <li>Creating and editing tables</li>
              <li>Using character styles (by discouraging the use of non-semantic visual styling of text, such as using large fonts in bold typeface to simulate headings)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <p>Based on the limited resources available to the development group, we ruled out the creation of a tables plugin. The other four options were chosen for design and development.</p>

            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>In some cases, image accessibility requirements involve more than adding simple alternative text for each image. How do we help authors understand that complex images require extra steps that go beyond adding 'alt text' in order to provide all of the information conveyed by such images to people with visual impairments? (Thorny problem)</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Explain (via the user interface) the concept of complex images and the additional accessibility requirements that their use entails.</li>
              <li>Explain/imply via the user interface that ‘alt text’ is insufficient for conveying all of the information conveyed by certain types of images such as charts, graphs and diagrams, and guide them on ways in which they can provide this information as part of the document itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>User testing of various approaches made it clear that trying to explain the concept of complex images did not work. People had a difficult time grasping what the implications were of this concept.</li>
              <li>People were more receptive to the idea that ‘alt text’, which provides a concise description of a simple image (for example, ‘car in motion on a country road’) was not useful as a text alternative for an image that conveys a large amount of information.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>

          <p>There have been more than 15,000 downloads of the A11yFirst plugins from the CKEditor website since late 2019.</p>

      <!-- SkipTo Landmarks & Headings -->

      <section>
        <h2>SkipTo Landmarks &amp; Headings</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The main purpose of the SkipTo Landmarks &amp; Headings browser extension is to provide keyboard-only users with a means for easily discovering and navigating to the landmark regions and top-level section headings of a web page, and conversely, for "skipping over" blocks of boilerplate content such as page headers and navigation menus.</p>
          <p>There are two secondary purposes for the extension: (a) allow anyone interested in structural navigation to view an outline of the page and easily navigate to a desired section, and (b) allow web designers and developers to evaluate the use of landmarks and headings on the page (for example, to check whether headings are properly structured).</p>
          <details>
            <summary>About the Design</summary>

            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>What keyboard shortcuts should be used to facilitate keyboard navigation?</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the first character of each menu item as a shortcut key to move to the next item that begins with that character (from WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices).</li>
              <li>For landmarks: use single-letter mnemonics for shortcuts (for example: press m for main, n for navigation, etc.) and for headings: press a number key 1–6 to move to the next heading of that level.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Typically, each page visited has very different content from other pages. This includes the text content of its headings. For the first characters of the headings to be useful, the user must become familiar with the text content of the headings.</li>
              <li>Some pages may have many headings (it is not uncommon for large pages to have over 100). The usefulness of first characters as shortcuts in these cases is diminished.</li>
              <li>Because the menu items are ever-changing from one page to the next (unlike the menus for most software applications), the option for using single-letter mnemonics for landmarks and number keys for headings was chosen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>By default, which landmarks and heading levels should be included in the menu, and in what order should landmarks be displayed? Note: Headings are always displayed in document order.</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Show all landmarks and headings.</li>
              <li>Limit the number of landmarks and headings in the menu to maximize usability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Based on what this extension is trying to achieve (i.e., serving mainly as an assistive technology), it is felt that only certain landmarks should be displayed and in a particular order.</li>
              <li>The extension includes ‘main’, ‘search’, ‘navigation’, ‘complementary’ (optional) and ‘contentinfo’ landmarks, in that order. It does not include ‘banner’, ‘form’ or ‘application’ landmarks.</li>
              <li>For some pages, showing all of the headings can result in many menu items, sometimes numbering in the hundreds. By default, only heading levels 1–3 are shown.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
          <p>SkipTo Landmarks &amp; Headings was published in June 2021 as both a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skipto-landmarks-headings/fjkpbfcodhflpdildjbmdhhmcoplghgf">Chrome extension</a> and a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skipto/">Firefox extension</a>.</p>

      <!-- Accessibility Bookmarklets -->

        <h2>Accessibility Bookmarklets</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The <a href="https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/">Accessibility Bookmarklets</a> are the end result of what started as a 10 minute demonstration at a monthly campus accessibility meeting. During that meeting, a web developer from a regional consulting firm named Pixo showed the group a bookmarklet she had developed that visually outlined the ARIA landmark regions on a web page.</p>
          <p>It became apparent that additional bookmarklets could be developed that provided interactive visualizations corresponding to other categories of accessibility requirements, such as <em>headings</em>, <em>lists</em>, <em>images</em> and <em>forms</em>.</p>
          <p>Through collaboration over many months, we developed a set of five bookmarklets, which many developers have found useful in getting an initial sense of whether a web page meets certain accessibility requirements.</p>

      <!-- Accessible IT Group Website -->

      <section>
        <h2>Accessible IT Group: Web Design</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Designed over the period from summer of 2020 to spring of 2021 and utilizing a WordPress theme mostly built from scratch during that same period, the <a href="https://accessibleit.disability.illinois.edu/">Accessible IT Group website</a> highlights the training courses, accessibility tools and other services that the group provides.</p>
          <p>Aside from its role as a publishing platform for the content described above, one of the main purposes for building the site was for it to serve as an example of how to design and build a website with accessibility as a primary focus.</p>
          <p>For example, the user interface, and in particular the menu system, incorporates SVG images that are capable of adapting their foreground colors to maintain visibility when using high-contrast mode.</p>
          <p>Also, as one would expect of current websites, the design is fully responsive in adapting to the widely varying screen dimensions of modern devices.</p>
          <details>
            <summary>About the Design</summary>
            <p>There were two purposes in creating the Accessible IT Group (AITG) website:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To communicate what the group offered by way of services and software tools</li>
              <li>To provide a WordPress website that would serve as a model for functional accessibility in modern web design</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The functional accessibility features are exemplified by the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Top-level website menu based on WAI-ARIA disclosure navigation menu pattern</li>
              <li>SkipTo script providing structural navigation of page content</li>
              <li>Proper use of headings for labeling sections of content</li>
              <li>Responsive design for various form factors (menu system adapts down to phone screen size)</li>
              <li>Use of SVG images in the user interface that maintain visibility in high contrast mode (menu icons, search button icon)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The visual design is based on UIUC design guidelines for fonts and color palette.</p>
