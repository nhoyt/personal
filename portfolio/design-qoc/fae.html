<!-- FAE -->

<p>When you use FAE to evaluate the accessibility of a website, the evaluation results for each page consist of many data points: over 100 rules divided into 12 categories are applied, and the results for each rule include lists of elements that passed or failed. With this much data, our initial usability testing showed that users were feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to apply the results in order to improve the accessibility of their websites.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>How should we organize and present the evaluation results such that they are useful to people who may have various roles regarding their responsibilities for ensuring that websites are accessible?</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>We conducted a user research activity known as a “wants and needs analysis” in which we posed the question: If you could have any kind of accessibility evaluation tool at your disposal, how would you want to use it and what would you hope to be able to do with the results it produces? The analysis produced the following insights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The tool should help developers understand the accessibility issues they need to address, as well as provide all of the necessary information on “how” to address those issues. In other words, it should answer the questions: what is broken and how do I fix it?</li>
  <li>While the tool may be very useful for web developers, how does a developer convince her manager that these issues are worth allocating significant resources in order to address them?</li>
  <li>Could the evaluation results be presented in multiple ways, such that a developer would understand the low-level technical aspects of how to meet particular accessibility requirements, while at the same time, a non-technical person, perhaps a manager responsible for the content and main purpose of a website, could understand overall the degree to which the website succeeds or fails in meeting accessibility requirements?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>In analyzing the results of the “wants and needs analysis”, we determined that the starting point for any user, technical or non-technical, when presented with the FAE evaluation results, should be a “Summary Report” that provides numerical data showing percentages of rules that passed or failed.</p>
<p>The Summary Report should answer the following question in a straightforward manner: Are we in good shape, bad shape, or somewhere in between?</p>
<p>We concluded that if done properly, the Summary Report is what a developer could show a manager in order to give them a general sense of where things stand at present regarding the accessibility of their website to people with disabilities.</p>
