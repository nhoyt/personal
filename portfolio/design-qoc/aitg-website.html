<!-- AITG Website -->

<p>There were two purposes in creating the Accessible IT Group (AITG) website:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To communicate what the group offered by way of services and software tools</li>
  <li>To provide a WordPress website that would serve as a model for functional accessibility in modern web design</li>
</ol>

<p>The functional accessibility features are exemplified by the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigation menu based on WAI-ARIA menu pattern</li>
  <li>SkipTo script providing structural navigation of page content</li>
  <li>Proper use of headings for labeling sections of content</li>
  <li>Responsive design for various form factors (menu system adapts down to phone screen size)</li>
  <li>Use of SVG images in the user interface that maintain visibility in high contrast mode (menu icons, search button icon)</li>
</ul>

<p>The visual design is based on UIUC design guidelines for fonts and color palette.</p>
