<!-- AInspector WCAG -->

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>How to align all of the terminology and labeling of features present in AInspector with those in FAE and keep them in sync?</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Manually and simultaneously make changes in both applications whenever a terminology or feature change occurs in one or the other.</li>
  <li>Create a separate repository where all of the terminology and UI labeling is defined, and then make sure that both applications are kept in sync with it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>Based on a 2002 paper, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220382707_Conceptual_models_begin_by_designing_what_to_design"><i> Conceptual models: begin by designing what to design (PDF)</i></a> by Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson, I created the <a href="https://github.com/ainspector/design/wiki/Conceptual-Model-for-Web-Accessibility-Evaluation">Conceptual Model for Web Accessibility Evaluation</a>. I was the author and editor of the conceptual model, but its content is based on extensive input from our multi-organization group whose membership included a number of web accessibility experts.</p>
<p>This conceptual model served as the basis for all terminology, and the organization of evaluation results in all AInspector screens and FAE reports.</p>
