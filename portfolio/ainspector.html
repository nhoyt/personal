        <h2>Product Definition</h2>
        <div>
          <p>AInspector uses the same Evaluation Library as the Functional Accessibility Evaluator, and thus its evaluation results are presented in the same format, using the same terminology and ruleset as FAE.</p>
          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>How to align all of the terminology and labeling of features present in AInspector with those in FAE and keep them in sync?</p>

          <h3>Options</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Manually and simultaneously make changes in both applications whenever a terminology or feature change occurs in one or the other.</li>
            <li>Create a separate repository where all of the terminology and UI labeling is defined, and then make sure that both applications are kept in sync with it.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Criteria</h3>
          <p>Based on a 2002 paper, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220382707_Conceptual_models_begin_by_designing_what_to_design"><i> Conceptual models: begin by designing what to design (PDF)</i></a> by Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson, I created the <a href="https://github.com/ainspector/design/wiki/Conceptual-Model-for-Web-Accessibility-Evaluation">Conceptual Model for Web Accessibility Evaluation</a>. I was the author and editor of the conceptual model, but its content is based on extensive input from our multi-organization group whose membership included a number of web accessibility experts.</p>
          <p>This conceptual model served as the basis for all terminology, and the organization of evaluation results in all AInspector screens and FAE reports.</p>

          <p>The first publicly available version of AInspector was released in Sep. 2014. It was designed and developed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">XUL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPCOM">XPCOM</a>, which predated the current WebExtensions APIs.</p>
          <p>After Mozilla stopped supporting XUL-based add-ons in Nov. 2017, the add-on was ported to use the latest WebExtensions APIs.</p>
          <p>AInspector has been updated in 2022 with additional features, including the ability to export data in CSV format. Version 2.0 was released in March.</p>
