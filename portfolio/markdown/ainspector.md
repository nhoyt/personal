## Overview

[AInspector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ainspector-wcag/), a Firefox browser extension, is the primary accessibility evaluation tool used by web developers, designers, and quality assurance testers at the University of Illinois.

It was first released in September 2014 and about three years later was updated to use the WebExtensions API that was subsequently required by Mozilla. In March 2022, version 2.0 of AInspector was released with significant enhancements, including the ability to export evaluation results in CSV format.

### My Role

I was the user interface and interaction designer of the first version of AInspector, working in conjunction with the product manager who is also a developer and accessibility expert. I acted in an advisory capacity for more recent design improvements to AInspector, such as those in version 2.0.

## Product Definition

The initial version of AInspector had ambitious goals that were tied to another product, a previously developed web application named the Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE), which used web spidering to evaluate entire websites.

Much work had gone into FAE (I was the user interface and interaction designer for that product), to the point that we already had developed an information architecture that drove the reporting formats for a very large dataset of accessibility evaluation results.

AInspector was conceived to be the single-page version of FAE. Because FAE was layered on top of the OpenA11y Evaluation Library, we knew that it would be advantageous if AInspector could also utilize the same library.

However, we also realized that having two separate products that reported or displayed evaluation results in the same format presented a challenge relating to their user interfaces. The labeling of evaluation results in FAE was built into the reporting interface.
