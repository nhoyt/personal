  <h2>Conceptual Models</h2>
  <div>
    <p>In summing up my past experience as a designer, I would be remiss if I did not mention the importance of discovering the value and benefits of conceptual modeling. The book I recommend on this topic is <em>Conceptual Models: Core to Good Design</em> by Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, the purpose of creating a conceptual model for an application is to clarify all of the internal relationships of the objects and actions that users encounter as they perform the various tasks necessary to accomplish their goals.</p>
    <p>When designing multiple applications that are based on the same kinds of actions and objects, a conceptual model also becomes invaluable for maintaining consistency with terminology, and especially the labels that users interact with across those applications.</p>
