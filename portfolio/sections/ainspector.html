        <div>
          <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ainspector-wcag/">AInspector for Firefox</a> is an open source browser extension that evaluates web pages for compliance with widely accepted accessibility requirements defined by WCAG Levels A and AA, WAI-ARIA, and the HTML5 standard.</p>
          <p>The design challenge for this project was to take an extremely large dataset and create a user interface and information architecture that utilizes a multi-level approach of progressive disclosure, allowing the user to gently delve into lower levels of detail depending on their needs.</p>
          <p>AInspector for Firefox is used by web developers to assess and improve the accessibility of their websites at the University of Illinois, Penn State, The Ohio State University, the University of Iowa and Indiana University.</p>

          <!--
          <p>AInspector uses the same Evaluation Library as the Functional Accessibility Evaluator, and thus its evaluation results are presented in the same format, using the same terminology and ruleset as FAE.</p>

            <summary>About the Design</summary>
            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>How to align all of the terminology and labeling of features present in AInspector with those in FAE and keep them in sync?</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Manually and simultaneously make changes in both applications whenever a terminology or feature change occurs in one or the other.</li>
              <li>Create a separate repository where all of the terminology and UI labeling is defined, and then make sure that both applications are kept in sync with it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <p>Based on a 2002 paper, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220382707_Conceptual_models_begin_by_designing_what_to_design"><i> Conceptual models: begin by designing what to design (PDF)</i></a> by Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson, I created the <a href="https://github.com/ainspector/design/wiki/Conceptual-Model-for-Web-Accessibility-Evaluation">Conceptual Model for Web Accessibility Evaluation</a>. I was the author and editor of the conceptual model, but its content is based on extensive input from our multi-organization group whose membership included a number of web accessibility experts.</p>
            <p>This conceptual model served as the basis for all terminology, and the organization of evaluation results in all AInspector screens and FAE reports.</p>
          </details>
          <p>The first publicly available version of AInspector was released in Sep. 2014. It was designed and developed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">XUL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPCOM">XPCOM</a>, which predated the current WebExtensions APIs.</p>
          <p>After Mozilla stopped supporting XUL-based add-ons in Nov. 2017, the add-on was ported to use the latest WebExtensions APIs.</p>
          <p>AInspector has been updated in 2022 with additional features, including the ability to export data in CSV format. Version 2.0 was released in March.</p>
