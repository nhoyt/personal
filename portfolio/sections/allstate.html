          <p>The Call Center Resources App for Allstate Insurance involved designing an application that would provide a unified source of information for call center representatives to reference in answering questions for policy holders.</p>
          <p>This project depended heavily on creating an information architecture that aligned with the mental models that call center reps had regarding the categories of information they needed to access.</p>
          <p>To learn more about these mental models, I conducted a number of task modeling sessions, in which a group of call center representatives were asked about their day-to-day activities, and the types of information they needed to reference, as well as the best labels for these categories.</p>
          <p>Through iterative refinement of the labels for various categories of information, where group consensus was sought until there was agreement that each label provided the correct “information scent”, a successful IA was created that significantly increased the efficiency of finding the appropriate information needed for the task at hand.</p>
