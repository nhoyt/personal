  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Welcome to my online design portfolio, where I describe some of the projects on which I've had the privilege of serving as lead designer.</p>
    <p>Many of these projects, in particular those involving web applications, browser extensions or plugins, required the use of interaction design, a collection of methodologies best defined by Alan Cooper in his book <em>About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</em>.</p>
    <p>While the concept of interaction design is not easy to define, Cooper begins by delving into a methodology he calls <em>goal-directed design</em>, which involves developing a deep understanding of users' goals as they relate to a digital product. From the very first chapter, one gets a sense of the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of the value and effectiveness of interaction design.</p>
    <p>It is difficult to overstate how influential and important Cooper's <em>About Face</em> was to my professional development as a designer.</p>
    <p>If you have an interest in UX/UI design, you owe it to yourself to <strong>get this book!</strong></p>
