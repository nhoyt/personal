          <p>The <a href="https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/">Accessibility Bookmarklets</a> are the end result of what started as a 10 minute demonstration at a monthly campus accessibility meeting. During that meeting, a web developer from a regional consulting firm named Pixo showed the group a bookmarklet she had developed that visually outlined the ARIA landmark regions on a web page.</p>
          <p>It became apparent that additional bookmarklets could be developed that provided interactive visualizations corresponding to other categories of accessibility requirements, such as <em>headings</em>, <em>lists</em>, <em>images</em> and <em>forms</em>.</p>
          -->
          <p>The <a href="https://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/">Accessibility Bookmarklets</a> make visible various accessibility features on a web page that are otherwise hidden, including heading levels, landmarks, form control/label relationships, list markup and image alternative text.</p>
          <p>In collaboration with members of the local accessibility community, I designed and developed a set of five bookmarklets, which are freely available and easily installable in any browser.</p>
          <p>The Accessibility Bookmarklets have become popular among campus web designers and developers. They provide a lightweight method of making an initial assessment of whether a web page meets the accessibility requirements within a given category of compliance.</p>
