          <p>The <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/search/plugins/a11yfirst">A11yFirst Plugins for CKEditor</a> are document editing enhancements that promote and encourage the creation of accessible content as you edit.</p>
          <!--
          <p>In contrast to the accessibility checker approach for embedded HTML editors, the A11yFirst Project takes a proactive approach to accessible authoring.</p>
          <p>The A11yFirst Project was responsible for creating four editing plugins for CKEditor 4: ‘Heading/Paragraph’, ‘Character Style’, ‘Image’ and ‘Link’, along with a ‘Help’ system that explained the various choices in the associated dialog boxes and menus.</p>
          -->
          <p>The design challenge for this project was making the user interface for each plugin comprehensible to users such that it was clear that choosing particular options that the interface proactively offered would significantly improve the accessibility of their document.</p>

            <summary>About the Design</summary>

            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>Which editor functions provide opportunities for proactively assisting authors in creating accessible content as they edit, as opposed to forcing authors to use accessibility checking tools that are tangential to the editing process?</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Inserting headings</li>
              <li>Inserting images</li>
              <li>Creating links</li>
              <li>Creating and editing tables</li>
              <li>Using character styles (by discouraging the use of non-semantic visual styling of text, such as using large fonts in bold typeface to simulate headings)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <p>Based on the limited resources available to the development group, we ruled out the creation of a tables plugin. The other four options were chosen for design and development.</p>

            <h3>Question</h3>
            <p>In some cases, image accessibility requirements involve more than adding simple alternative text for each image. How do we help authors understand that complex images require extra steps that go beyond adding 'alt text' in order to provide all of the information conveyed by such images to people with visual impairments? (Thorny problem)</p>

            <h3>Options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Explain (via the user interface) the concept of complex images and the additional accessibility requirements that their use entails.</li>
              <li>Explain/imply via the user interface that ‘alt text’ is insufficient for conveying all of the information conveyed by certain types of images such as charts, graphs and diagrams, and guide them on ways in which they can provide this information as part of the document itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Criteria</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>User testing of various approaches made it clear that trying to explain the concept of complex images did not work. People had a difficult time grasping what the implications were of this concept.</li>
              <li>People were more receptive to the idea that ‘alt text’, which provides a concise description of a simple image (for example, ‘car in motion on a country road’) was not useful as a text alternative for an image that conveys a large amount of information.</li>
            </ul>
          </details>

          <p>There have been more than 15,000 downloads of the A11yFirst plugins from the CKEditor website since late 2019.</p>
