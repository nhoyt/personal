        <h2>Accessible IT Group: Web Design</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Designed over the period from summer of 2020 to spring of 2021 and utilizing a WordPress theme mostly built from scratch during that same period, the <a href="https://accessibleit.disability.illinois.edu/">Accessible IT Group website</a> highlights the training courses, accessibility tools and other services that the group provides.</p>
          <p>Aside from its role as a publishing platform for the content described above, one of the main purposes for building the site was for it to serve as an example of how to design and build a website with accessibility as a primary focus.</p>
          <p>For example, the user interface, and in particular the menu system, incorporates SVG images that are capable of adapting their foreground colors to maintain visibility when using high-contrast mode.</p>
          <p>Also, as one would expect of current websites, the design is fully responsive in adapting to the widely varying screen dimensions of modern devices.</p>
          <details>
            <summary>About the Design</summary>
            <p>There were two purposes in creating the Accessible IT Group (AITG) website:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To communicate what the group offered by way of services and software tools</li>
              <li>To provide a WordPress website that would serve as a model for functional accessibility in modern web design</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The functional accessibility features are exemplified by the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Top-level website menu based on WAI-ARIA disclosure navigation menu pattern</li>
              <li>SkipTo script providing structural navigation of page content</li>
              <li>Proper use of headings for labeling sections of content</li>
              <li>Responsive design for various form factors (menu system adapts down to phone screen size)</li>
              <li>Use of SVG images in the user interface that maintain visibility in high contrast mode (menu icons, search button icon)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The visual design is based on UIUC design guidelines for fonts and color palette.</p>
